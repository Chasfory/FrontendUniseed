Technical test including a frontend from the FrontendUniseed project  

This is the realization of the frontend for a login and signup page  

This software was created using ReactJs software, the boostrap library and axios  

There are pages, one to create an account with the argument email address, name, first name and password requested twice for additional verification. Another to connect which just asks for the email address and the password and which contains the remember me and forgotten password buttons which does not redirect to any other page. The data will be sent to the Backend part (see the BackendUniseed project)  

Idea to do functional tests in python with the pytest library  

Install ReactJs:  

npm install  
- https://fr.reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html  
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios  
- https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/  
- https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/whatever/npm+install+%40fortawesome%2Freact-fontawesome  

Launch the server:  
npmstart  

The resources:  
In the login folder -> All the development of the login page  
In the signup folder -> All the development of the login page  
In the folder picture -> image used for the font of the site  
In the App file -> the routes that will be executed  
In the file connection -> database connection  
Program entry point -> index.js
